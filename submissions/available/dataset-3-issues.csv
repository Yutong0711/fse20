AMQ-264,14,"Durable subscriptions + Journal: causes sporatic ""Message probably expired: null"" error message.Matt Sinclair &lt;msd@msdservices.com&gt; Reported on the user list: 
  Hello, 
  I have been experiencing problems with ActiveMQ-3.1M2 dropping messages on durable subscriptions.On a test submitting some 70,000 messages, each with approximately 1K payloads, the broker stalled somewhere around 53,911 for a couple minutes.The broker's process began consuming 50% or more CPU, and the client was basically idle.After a couple minutes the broker began delivering messages but at a much slower rate.In the end, only 68398 of the 70000 messages were delivered.In the error log there were exactly 1602 ""Message probably expired: null"" error messages.In terms of timing, I am not sure how these error messages correlate with the stall, though I believe the stall occurred soon after these messages.Immediately prior to this problem and the 1602 messages there were a series of JMS exceptions in the broker's log.The exceptions are detailed below.This problem seems to be reproducible, though it happens less frequently with smaller batches of messages.For example, sending batches of 10000, 30000, and 50000 generally work fine.However, in tests sending batches of 50000 messages, exceptions about not being able to checkpoint the database were seen, though all messages were delivered.What is interesting is that checkpoint failure seems to corresponded with the last message or second to last message in the batch.Stacktraces are listed below.The broker, client, and producer are running on the same machine, connected via TCP transport.System is Java 1.4.2 on Mac OS X 10.3.9.I can test Solaris/Sparc on Java 5 if that would be helpful.Some of the problems appear to be ones previously reported on this list.Obviously, the reliability of the broker is troubling.If there is anything I can do, by way of running special builds or running more tests or etc., I would be more than willing to invest some time and resources in helping to track down and understand this serious problem.Matt Sinclair

AMQ-2779,18,"Propagate queue subscription selectors to virtual topic dispatch such that unmatched messages do not pile up on subscription queues.With virtual topics each consumer can get its own queue or share an existing queue.<URL> 
  Consumers which share a queue, can use selectors to partition the consumer queue but individual consumers that use selectors run into a problem in that the dispatch to the queue does not take account of the selector and all messages are dispatched to the queue.Over time, the unmatched messages build up on the queue.Through static configuration it is possible to arrange that the destination queues are filtered, but this solution is static.An alternative approach, that does impose a cpu hit during dispatch (as the selectors are executed twice) can provide a neat solution.Making a virtual topic selectorAware allows the destination interceptor to only dispatch messages that match the selector of one of the existing subscriptions.In this way, no unmatched messages will be dispatched to the subscription queues.In xml configuration, the following will make all topic dispatch respect the selectors of the existing subscriptions:

  Apparently a resource is missing.When I take a look at `R.java`, I find it in there: 
   public static final class color {

   &lt;config-file target=""res/values/colors.xml"" parent=""/resources""&gt; &lt;color name=""color_myfragment_background_selected""&gt;#03abb4&lt;/color&gt; 
  and of course, when I started paying attention to what `adb install -r thing.apk` outputs, I noticed this:

  That code is being used to pause the app while the notification centre, or control centre are displayed ??? it is also used anytime there is a notification received on the screen (like a low battery indication or a phone call).The code works perfectly, except that it does not stop the audio while pausing the game.The audio keeps playing in background, while the game is paused.Also, now that I have introduced this code - my game behaves differently when I resume it after a while / before using the mentioned code I could leave the game in the background for hours and then return to it and the game was going to be exactly where I left it.Now with the new code, when I return to the game after minutes of being idle I see the game where I left it but for like 3 seconds only and then the game restarts.Is there a relation between the code used and this bug?I believe there is because that was not happening before using it,

  We're writing to let you know that the apps listed at the end of this email may be affected by an upcoming platform change.Action required: If your app requires GPS hardware to operate properly, you will need to explicitly add the ""android.hardware.location.gps"" uses-feature to your manifest.What??? changing 
  We???e making a change on October 15th, 2016 that will affect apps targeting API version 21 (Android 5.0, Lollipop) or higher that use ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION but don't explicitly have the ""android.hardware.location.gps"" uses-feature.Going forward, these apps will be available to install on devices that don't have GPS hardware.In most cases this won't be an issue since Wi-Fi and Cell-ID based location provides high enough fidelity for the typical operation of these apps.However, any apps that require GPS hardware, such as GPS navigators, should explicitly add the ""android.hardware.location.gps"" uses-feature to their manifest.If your app requires GPS to function properly and you do not include android.hardware.location.gps in your manifest declaration, your users may have a poor app experience.Also, if you???e using the fused location provider and wish to receive the most accurate location samples from GPS (i.e. with PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY), you must include the ""android.hardware.location.gps"" feature in your app??? manifest to ensure that Google Play only distributes your app to devices with GPS sensors.You can read more about this change in the Android Developers Help Center.Regards,

  Current Behavior 
  <ol> 
   Selecting a large image (in filesize) through the plugin creates a delay before returning control to the Cordova app which uses the plugin.This includes both: 
     
     Camera capture 
     Image gallery 
      
   This delay increases in a linear fashion with the filesize of the selected image

     Return control immediately to the Cordova app which uses the plugin 
     Continue the data transfer of the image to the Cordova app in a background thread

   This includes both:

CB-1738,132,"PhoneGap iOS 6 -  network.connection.type issue when turning OFF airplane mode.30Oct, 2012 
  Apple Bug Report: Problem ID: 12602276  
  -------------------------------------------------------- update on 26Oct, 2012 
  After more investigation I think this probably is an iOS6 issue The PhoneGap API returns ""wifi"" when the wifi symbol actually shows up ( the radio status probably doesn't matter ) on banner My application will invoke an RPC , which will fail due to error ""A server with specified hostname could not be found"" Code= 1003 
  So I think the problem is iOS6 lies about the status, It says wifi is ready while it is not entirely.From my observation error occurs within 15s after wifi symbol shows up.After 15s almost for sure there will be no network error.This issue cannot be reproduced on iOS5.It could be a problem within a LAN environment too ( I am hitting a server within company domain ) 
  PhoneGap probably got tricked by the iOS network status too.Maybe there is something else PhoneGap can check, but not sure.Meanwhile I will lower the bug priority and report an issue to Apple.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  24Oct 2012 I have an app that talks to a server.Before making an RPC I use the PG API to check for connectivity: 
   <URL> code snippet: 
   var networkState = navigator.network.connection.type 
   if (networkState == ""none"" || networkState == ""unknown"") { //DO NOT make connection } 
  Scenario: ( i am testing on two iPhone4 , one running OS5 ,and one on OS6)  
  1.Turn ON airplane mode from setting.wait until the radio and wifi are fully OFF  
  2.Turn OFF airplane, quickly switch to my app and make an RPC, make sure on the top left of the banner the connectivity status is showing ""searching..."" 
  3.Expect to see networkState as ""unknown"" (iOS5 behavior).but it returns ""wifi"" (iOS6) 
  another minor observation - on iOS6 it takes double time to turn off the airplane mode.iOS5 it takes like around 3 seconds to have the connectivity reestablished, before i finish the following actions: toggle the mode button, close the setting app.foreground my app, click on a button.iOS6 it takes like 6 seconds, which makes the bug more easy to reproduce.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",no,,"[gk7_speed, pf2_duration]"

  Myapp-Info.plist: 
  Bundle versions string, short: 1.0.0 (this is what will show in the app store) Bundle version: 0.0.3 (this is some other build number) 
  Android: 
  AndroidManifest.xml: 
  android:versionCode=""1"" android:versionName=""0.0.3"" 
  versionName is what shows in the stores, and versionCode is typically used like a build number (as far as I can tell).My point is, in the cordova.xml, I only have the ability to set one of these version numbers.There is only a single ""version"" attribute.But we need two attributes, so we can set both version strings via the CLI.Secondly, how the ""version"" attribute is applied when building via the CLI is inconsistent.On iOS it's updating the ""build"" number, and not even touching the main version number that users will see in the store.Whereas Android has what I would expect as the correct behaviour.Anyway, please let me know if I've misunderstood anything.",no,,[]

CB-9227,220,"Malfunction OnlineEventsBridgeMode.While hunting a bug resulting in file API not reporting success/failure during asynchronous calls, we had learned that OnlineEventsBridgeMode (NativeToJsMessageQueue.java) seem to be broken.We noticed that from a certain point in time, the Boolean online was always set to false during: toggleNetworkRunnable  { ... webView.setNetworkAvailable(online) } 
    Consequently there were no more online/offline events triggered at the JS and no more consequent polling of messages.To be more precise, events from JAVA to JS were delivered only when someone from the JS was calling androidExec (cordova.js) and never during online/offline events.As a result, we were always missing the last set of events as there were stuck down at the JAVA queue resulting in application freeze.(Once that started, the Boolean online was no longer being toggled via notifyOfFlush resulting in a permanent failure resolved only when reloading the software).As far as we understand, WebView only deliverers online/offline events to JS if the state of the Network changes i.e. if after a call to webView.setNetworkAvailable(false) one would call webView.setNetworkAvailable(true) and vice versa.This means that by design, Cordova seeks to maintain the Boolean online to maintain the inverse state of the WebView Network state.If/when the Boolean online looses track of the WebView Network state, the system online/offline events are discontinued until software reloading.Till now we were unable to track down the exact sequence leading the Boolean online to loose track of the WebView Network state in our system, but we do notice a sequence of two consecutive calls to notifyOfFlush, flipping the Boolean online twice - thereafter the Boolean online seem to have lost track of the WebView Network state and online/offline events no longer propagated to JS.If our understanding is indeed correct.....than, our main concern is that this design does not converge to a stable state and that inview of the asynchronous nature of the design and reliance on WebView specifics, a KISS methodology which would not put the code at risk of coming into a complete halt in view of a single mishap may be better.I.e. a design with a better self healing property following mishaps.We tried out a simple modification by replacing: webView.setNetworkAvailable(online);  with:  webView.setNetworkAvailable(true); // trigger an event  webView.setNetworkAvailable(false); // reset the webView to its default state 
  This had apparently solved the issues in our S3 Neo android 4.3 device though more testing are needed.If this approach is adopted, it requires cleaning up the code and removing now redundant code such as the notifyOfFlush mechanism which would no longer be needed, same for the JS event listener for offline events etc.This we hope would result in overall simplification of code in this area and better stability and endurance to mishaps.On the negative side, this alternative design results in doubling the amount of times in which webView.setNetworkAvailable() is toggled - forcing certain overhead.Yet, notice that there is no longer a need for cordova.js to listen to offline events, such that the added offline processing is now limited to the WebView internal overhead which is likely to be slim.",no,,"[sk1_negative_necessary, sk14_overhead, ss11_rework]"

FLEX-26532,395,"Provide a way of dynamically changing the threshold between touch scrolling and selection.When your finger interacts with a touch screen there is almost always some movement between the mouseDown/mouseMove(s)/mouseUp.Flex watches these differences to determine if the touch looks like clicking/selecting something or if it looks more like a drag/throw to induce scrolling.Currently this ""slop"" threshold is a constant size (20 pixels on a 240dpi device) meaning that if you try to make a small scrolling gesture that went less than 20 pixels it won't be considered a scrolling movement.This threshold could be made much smaller if the area the finger is touching isn't over something clickable/selectable, for example panning in a Photo viewer application.It would be great if Flex could detect this kind of a situation and automatically adjust the slop accordingly.If you compare the Angry Birds and ""Settings"" apps on Android you will see that panning in the Angry Birds game has a very small slop and the Settings app has a larger slop.This automatic adjusting should give Flex developers this behavior by default without any changes in their code.In addition to automatically choosing the slop threshold it might be worthwhile considering providing an API for it too.For example, if you compare the Angry Birds application on iPad with panning around a photo in the Photos application you will see two different slop thresholds even though neither situation has a risk of selection.",no,,[]
FLEX-26616,396,"SkinnableContainer: measuredMinWidth/measuredMinHeight contract is broken..See the attached example: Upon creation the container's measuredMinHeight/minHeight is 0.This is due to a hack in SkinnableContainerSkin where the contentGroup has its minWidth/minHeight set to 0.This makes measuredMinWidth/measuredMinHeight obsolete in the whole application seeing as SkinnableContainers are widely used.One particular use case I have in mind is a modular application where a number of modules are launched in popups.With this hack in, I can't offer to provide resizing facilities till the natural (measured) minWidth/minHeight of the popup'ed component is reached (The expected behavior).Instead, I have to tell module developers to set an explicit minWidth/minHeight at the top level view of their module which is annoying for a number of reasons (One of which is that they have to remember to re-evaluate these values everytime they change the content of their module).I understand the hack was put in place to fix another bug, but it came with its issues too.Was it worth it ?Isn't there a better fix ?",no,,[ss11_rework]

  The ordering of the first three rows is indeterminate in the presence of the cross-replication, so after compaction,&nbsp;in the&nbsp;master cluster&nbsp;you will see ???ow Key 1, CF0::Column1, Timestamp1??? having the value 3, but in the slave cluster, you might see the cell having one of the three possible values 1, 2, 3, which results in data inconsistency issue between&nbsp;the master and slave clusters.Root Cause Analysis: 
  In HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint.createBatches() of branch-1.3, the WAL entries from the same region could be split into different batches according to replication RPC limit and these batches are shipped by ReplicationSource concurrently, so the batches for the same region could arrive at the sink in the slave clusters then apply to the region synchronously in indeterminate order.Solution: 
  In HBase 3.0.0 and 2.1.0, 
   <ERROR></ERROR>&amp;
   <URL>&amp;
   <URL>&nbsp;provided Serial Replication&nbsp;
   <URL>&nbsp;which guarantees the order of pushing logs to slave clusters is same as the order of requests from client in the master cluster.It contains mainly two changes: 
  <ol> 
   Recording the replication ""barriers"" in ZooKeeper to synchronize the replication across old/failed RS and new RS to provide strict ordering semantics even in the presence of region-move or RS failure.Make sure the batches within one region are shipped to the slave clusters in order.</ol> 
  The second part of change is exactly what we need and the minimal change to fix the issue in this JIRA.To fix the issue in this JIRA, we have two options: 
  <ol> 
   Cherry-Pick 
    <URL>&nbsp;to branch 1.3.Pros: It also fixes the data inconsistency issue when there is region-move or RS failure and help to reduce the noises in our cross-cluster replication/backup validation which is our ultimate goal.Cons: the change is big and I'm not sure for now whether the change is self-contained or it has other dependencies which need to port to branch 1.3 too; and we need longer time to validate&nbsp;and stabilize.Port the minimal change or make the equivalent change as the second part of&nbsp;
    <URL> to make sure the batches within one region are shipped to the slave clusters in order.""</ol>

HBASE-8644,733,"""hbck -fixReferenceFiles"" checks for write permissions in / even if sidelineDir is specified.We found a situation where a temporary reference file got left in META's recovered.edits directory and this was causing hbck to report inconsistency with HBase.When trying to repair it with the ""hbck -fixReferenceFiles"" command, an access control exception was thrown, because hbck was trying to put the sidelined reference file in the root of HDFS and the hbase user did not have permissions.But even after specifying a ""sidelineDir"" (hbck -fixReferenceFiles -sidelineDir hdfs://&lt;namespace&gt;/tmp), the same exception was thrown (logs obfuscated below): 
  INFO util.HBaseFsck: Trying to sildeline reference filehdfs://&lt;namespace&gt;/hbase/.META./1028685194/recovered.edits/0000000000000000016.temp to hdfs://&lt;namespace&gt;/0000000000000000016.temp  Exception in thread ""main"" org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: user=hbase, access=WRITE, inode=""/"":hdfs:hadoop:drwxr-xr-x  
  Since the operation requires moving data around in HDFS, we tried the same command as the ""hdfs"" user which should have no permission problems, but an exception was thrown nonetheless: 
  ...  WARN util.HBaseFsck: Got AccessControlException when preCheckPermission  org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: action=WRITE path=hdfs://&lt;namespace&gt;/hbase/<del>ROOT</del> user=hdfs  
  Ultimately in order to get this working, we ran this command to tell hbck to not run it's prechecks: 
  hbase hbck -fixReferenceFiles -sidelineDir hdfs://&lt;namespace&gt;/tmp -ignorePreCheckPermission 
  A few thoughts here: 
  1) it seems that / is a bad default location to attempt to sideline files 
  2) shouldn't hbck be run as the hbase user?If so, it should sideline files to a directory it has write permissions to.3) if we expect hbck to be run as the hdfs user, permissions should not be denied that user when HDFS itself will not deny them.",no,,[]

  There currently isn't a solution in Solr for doing geospatial filtering on documents that have a variable number of points.This scenario occurs when there is location extraction (i.e. via a ""gazateer"") occurring on free text.None, one, or many geospatial locations might be extracted from any given document and users want to limit their search results to those occurring in a user-specified area.I've implemented this by furthering the GeoHash based work in Lucene/Solr with a geohash prefix based filter.A geohash refers to a lat-lon box on the earth.Each successive character added further subdivides the box into a 4x8 (or 8x4 depending on the even/odd length of the geohash) grid.The first step in this scheme is figuring out which geohash grid squares cover the user's search query.I've added various extra methods to GeoHashUtils (and added tests) to assist in this purpose.The next step is an actual Lucene Filter, GeoHashPrefixFilter, that uses these geohash prefixes in TermsEnum.seek() to skip to relevant grid squares in the index.Once a matching geohash grid is found, the points therein are compared against the user's query to see if it matches.I created an abstraction GeoShape extended by subclasses named PointDistance... and CartesianBox....to support different queried shapes so that the filter need not care about these details.This work was presented at LuceneRevolution in Boston on October 8th.",no,,"[sk10_skip, tk3_memory_unit, ss11_rework]"

   <ERROR></ERROR> the ZK connection drops and the session expires.A new ZK session is established, and ElectionContext.cancelElection is called.Then register() is called and a new set of leader_elect ephemeral nodes are created.During the period between the ZK session expiring, and new set of leader_elect nodes being created the second machine starts.It creates its leader_elect ephemeral nodes, as there are no other nodes it wins the election and starts the leadership process.As its still missing one of its peers, it begins to block waiting for the third machine to join.There is now a race between machine1 &amp; machine2, both of whom think they are the leader.So far, this isn't too bad, because the machine that loses the race will fail when it tries to create the /collection/name/leader/shard1 node (as it already exists), and will rejoin the election.While this is happening, machine3 has started and has queued for leadership behind machine2.If the loser of the race is machine2, when it rejoins the election it cancels the current context, deleting it's leader_elect ephemeral nodes.At this point, machine3 believes it has become leader (the watcher it has on the leader_elect node fires), and it runs the LeaderElector::checkIfIAmLeader method.This method DELETES the current /collection/name/leader/shard1 node, then starts the leadership process (as all three machines are now running, it does not block to wait).So, machine1 won the race with machine2 and declared its leadership and created the nodes.However, machine3 has just deleted them, and recreated them for itself.So machine1 and machine3 both believe they are the leader.I am thinking that the fix should be to cancel &amp; close all election contexts immediately on reconnect (we do cancel them, however it's run serially which has blocking issues, and just canceling does not cause the wait loop to exit).That election context logic already has checks on the closed flag, so they should exit if they see it has been closed.I'm working on a patch for this.",yes,it begins to block waiting for the third machine,[]

  The default of facet.distrib.mco=false would be changed to facet.distrib.mco=true.<h3><a name=""Whenisthisoptioneffective%3F""></a>When is this option effective?</h3> 
  From the documentation, 
  <SOURCECODE> 
  <h3><a name=""Whatistheresultofturningthisoptionon%3F""></a>What is the result of turning this option on?</h3> 
  When facet.distrib.mco=true is used, and the conditions above are met, then when Solr is sending requests off to the various shards it will include facet.mincount=1.The result of this is that only terms with a count &gt; 0 will be considered when processing the request for that shard.This can result in a significant performance gain when the field has high cardinality and the matching docset is relatively small because terms with 0 matches will not be considered.As shown in 
   <URL>, the runtime of a single query was reduced from 20 seconds to less than 1 second.<h3><a name=""Canthischangeresultinworseperformance%3F""></a>Can this change result in worse performance?</h3> 
  The current thinking is no, worse performance won't be experienced even under non-optimal scenarios.From the comments in 
   <URL>,  
  <blockquote> 
   Consider you asked for up to 10 terms from shardA with mincount=1 but you received only 5 terms back.In this case you know, definitively, that a term seen in the response from shardB but not in the response from shardA could have at most a count of 0 in shardA.If it had any other count in shardA then it would have been returned in the response from shardA.Also, if you asked for up to 10 terms from shardA with mincount=1 and you get back a response with 10 terms having a count &gt;= 1 then the response is identical to the one you'd have received if mincount=0.Because of this, there isn't a scenario where the response would result in more work than would have been required if mincount=0.For this reason, the decrease in required work when mincount=1 is always either a moot point or a net win.</blockquote> 
  The belief here is that it is safe to change the default of facet.distrib.mco such that facet.mincount=1 will be used when appropriate.The overall performance gain can be significant and there is no seen performance cost.",yes,worse performance won't be experienced even under non-optimal scenarios.,[]
