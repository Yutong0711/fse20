- subversion handles content-type property, maybe it would be worthful
   to keep the character set too (after-all Polish HTML pages
   has usually 
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-2
   instead of usual text/html, same apply for text/plain), I would imagine
   keeping content-charset property and (in case it exits) using it
   while producing Content-Type in HTTP header
- to implement transcoding I described, one would need some 'sandbox
property'
   (in this case 'sandbox charset' - win-1250 for Windows and
iso-8859-2 otherwise)
- maybe in some future we could keep the data in UTF-8 and use simple

  -------------------------------------------------------- update on 26Oct, 2012 
  After more investigation I think this probably is an iOS6 issue The PhoneGap API returns ""wifi"" when the wifi symbol actually shows up ( the radio status probably doesn't matter ) on banner My application will invoke an RPC , which will fail due to error ""A server with specified hostname could not be found"" Code= 1003

- subversion handles content-type property, maybe it would be worthful
   to keep the character set too (after-all Polish HTML pages
   has usually 
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-2
   instead of usual text/html, same apply for text/plain), I would imagine
   keeping content-charset property and (in case it exits) using it
   while producing Content-Type in HTTP header
- to implement transcoding I described, one would need some 'sandbox
property'
   (in this case 'sandbox charset' - win-1250 for Windows and
iso-8859-2 otherwise)
- maybe in some future we could keep the data in UTF-8 and use simple

- subversion handles content-type property, maybe it would be worthful
   to keep the character set too (after-all Polish HTML pages
   has usually 
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-2
   instead of usual text/html, same apply for text/plain), I would imagine
   keeping content-charset property and (in case it exits) using it
   while producing Content-Type in HTTP header
- to implement transcoding I described, one would need some 'sandbox
property'
   (in this case 'sandbox charset' - win-1250 for Windows and
iso-8859-2 otherwise)
- maybe in some future we could keep the data in UTF-8 and use simple

- subversion handles content-type property, maybe it would be worthful
   to keep the character set too (after-all Polish HTML pages
   has usually 
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-2
   instead of usual text/html, same apply for text/plain), I would imagine
   keeping content-charset property and (in case it exits) using it
   while producing Content-Type in HTTP header
- to implement transcoding I described, one would need some 'sandbox
property'
   (in this case 'sandbox charset' - win-1250 for Windows and
iso-8859-2 otherwise)
- maybe in some future we could keep the data in UTF-8 and use simple

- subversion handles content-type property, maybe it would be worthful
   to keep the character set too (after-all Polish HTML pages
   has usually 
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-2
   instead of usual text/html, same apply for text/plain), I would imagine
   keeping content-charset property and (in case it exits) using it
   while producing Content-Type in HTTP header
- to implement transcoding I described, one would need some 'sandbox
property'
   (in this case 'sandbox charset' - win-1250 for Windows and
iso-8859-2 otherwise)
- maybe in some future we could keep the data in UTF-8 and use simple
