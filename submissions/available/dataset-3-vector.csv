  -------------------------------------------------------- update on 26Oct, 2012 
  After more investigation I think this probably is an iOS6 issue The PhoneGap API returns ""wifi"" when the wifi symbol actually shows up ( the radio status probably doesn't matter ) on banner My application will invoke an RPC , which will fail due to error ""A server with specified hostname could not be found"" Code= 1003
